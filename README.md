<h3>What it does !!</h3>

AKA is a simple implementation of a shell in C.  It demonstrates the basics of
how a shell works.  That is: read, parse, fork, exec, and wait.  So I think it's
pretty cool.  Since it's a simple implementation, it has some limitations.

* Commands must be on a single line.
* Arguments must be separated by whitespace.
* No quoting arguments or escaping whitespace.
* No piping or redirection.
* Only builtins are: `cd`, `help`, `exit`, `hist`.

<h3>Prerequisite</h3>

* Unix/Linux Environment
* GCC Compiler

<h3>Running the Shell !!</h3>

1. Compile and execute `AKA-shell/main.c`.
2. Enter *User: User* and *Password: Password*.
